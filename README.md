I'm a **JavaScript/TypeScript developer** with 4+ years of commercial experience in Frontend. Mostly I worked with:
- React
- React Native
- Node JS scripting

In my work I always try to create as much efficient and architecturally correct solutions as possible. I have a good understanding of OOP principles, main architectural design patterns and their implementation and correct use in web applications. Always thinking about performance and ease of maintenance.
